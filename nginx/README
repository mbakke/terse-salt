BUGS/TODO

Currently nginx:conf items (i.e. virtual hosts) must be raw strings.

Gotchas when using YAML based configuration:

* Nested blocks are not supported (e.g. server inside http block)
* Multiple conflicting keys must be array (include, log_format)
* Numbers must be quoted (TODO: workaround)
* double quotes inside single quotes does not work (TODO: workaround)
